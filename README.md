## This is a tool for another project
This is a tool to simplify the process of viewing VTK files obtained in computations in an in-developement [NOA](https://github.com/grinisrit/noa) CFD application ([link one](https://github.com/grinisrit/noa/tree/master/docs/cfd), [link two](https://github.com/grinisrit/noa/tree/dev/test/cfd)).

## Known issues
* GIF export camera position could not be set
